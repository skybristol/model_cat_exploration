    "Now that we have a [container](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e8de96182cee42d134687cc) for model items in ScienceBase that we can operate against, it opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities for \"robots\" to do some work for us. This notebook explores what we might be able to get from the web links added into the mix. Theoretically, those represent a wealth of meaty material to help flesh out the model catalog as a useful resource. We can write some code that can go do some gathering, and then decide if there is anything that we can consistently bring back in to flesh out the items. Because we're doing this in code and this whole thing is experimental, we can be reasonably safe in writing information back into ScienceBase for use and evaluation. We just need to keep track of the parts of ScienceBase Items where we want to \"cede control to the robots\" and the parts we want to manage in some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different strategies for leveraging those links to get more information together. One interesting dynamic would be to simply index everything we find on subsequent landing pages and even spidering into the contents like any search engine. I've proposed in the past that ScienceBase could do this writ large, providing directed search engine functionality to go after linked content in meaningful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, I'm focusing on a couple ways of fishing for structured metadata. This little robot is essentially the machine we talk about when we say things about \"machine-readable\" metadata or other content. A couple of potential strategies occur to me:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content negotiation - Some web pages and applications accessible over HTTP enable content negotiation, which is a method for the requestor to negotiate the structure or substance of the content that is returned in a response. It can also do things like specify languages that content should be returned in. This is all based on what the server/application providing the content will actually support. You can't force the system to give you something it isn't prepared to deliver. Systems like ScienceBase and some other USGS platforms do support content negotiation with a couple different machine readable options, so it's worth trying to see what we might be able to use.\n",
    "* Structured metadata - There are a whole variety of ways that web systems have worked out to embed structured, machine-readable metadata within the HTML content delivered through web pages and web apps. Many of these coalesce around the schema.org set of content specifications to give us some degree of consistency to work from. One cool thing about these techniques is that they can be implemented right within the primary vehicle for web content delivery - the web page viewed by humans. Perhaps the coolest thing from a data science perspective is that the specifications and encoding methods really encourage explicit semantics (meaning we don't have to guess about what words mean), use of persistent identifiers and linking to associated registries (so we don't have to guess about disambiguating things), and linking between concepts that relate (so we can go after a wealth of information and tie it all together into a network/graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two, structured metadata probably offers us the most promise in terms of richness of content, consistency in resulting data, and overall ease of use. Unfortunately, the uptake of these methods in USGS is pretty abysmal, including in ScienceBase where we've not updated our use of schema.org metadata in 8 years or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last resort, we could fall back on painful web scraping methods where we essentially parse HTML content and try to extract useful information. These are painful, because every one would essentially be a mostly custom affair that is probably more trouble than its worth. I do show a small bit of that here just for demonstration purposes."

As I said above, structured metadata holds a lot more interest and potential. I'm only trying to see if there is some kind of JSON response as the simplest thing to deal with. With the requests package, I can add in an Accept header that will still give me text/html content to work with if my Accept header is not accepted. For now, I just use a try block to see if I can shove the JSON content into my data structure. It's crude, but effective for our immediate purpose.\n",

In this instance, I just try for anything we can get to evaluate for use.\n",

It parses HTML content using the Python BeautifulSoup package and returns the page title and any named meta tags with content. This can sometimes yield a reasonable description depending on a lot of factors. This is a really terrible way to try and go about things for any kind of consisency given the vagaries of content management systems, legacy content, and all kinds of factors. But it's some other stuff to look at. I put this into a function that could be built upon further if it turns out this is actually a reasonable source to think about. There are also some more robust alternatives to this like the ScrapingHub AutoExtract API that we could think about."

The use of SST data is purely for demonstration purposes only. We will run the tool twice, the first time we will set Composite Raster = true and +/- Days = 32, then we will rerun the tool with Composite Raster = false, and compare the outputs. For all Composite Raster and Divergence Tool analyses, valid raster inputs must contain a date within their name. These dates must follow the mm_dd_yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy format. The data folder specified above contains 8-day MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) scenes from September, 2016 to May, 2017. Important Note: the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool was designed to be an exploratory tool. Therefore, outputs from this tool are created as temporary datasets that will be deleted when your ArcMap session closes. To save an output: right click the data layer in ArcMap, click the Data item from the popup menu, and select the Make Permanent option.</p>\\n\\n<p>Example: where Composite Raster = True When Composite Raster = True and +/- Days = 32, the tool will consider any raster layer with a date that is plus or minus 32 days of the user specified input date. The Composite Raster and Divergence Tool merges these raster data together to create a composite raster, prioritizing data collected nearest the user specified date. By doing so, areas within the MODIS satellite data that are obscured by cloud cover are iteratively filled in with the most temporally relevant data. The tool stops filling in data gaps when the +/- Days limit is reached. Resulting in the creation of two new raster datasets, the Composite Raster, and the Composite Days Diff raster. The Composite Raster is the merged dataset, and the Composite Days Diff raster maps the difference in days of the user specified date and the dates of the input rasters used to create the Composite Raster.</p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\"Composite Raster output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool, where the Composite Raster option is set to true\" src=\"https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/repos/foxcompositerasteranddivergencetool/browse/Images/figure2.png?raw=\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; max-width:100%; padding:0px\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Figure 2. Composite Raster output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool, where the Composite Raster option is set to true.</p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\"Composite Days Diff output\" src=\"https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/repos/foxcompositerasteranddivergencetool/browse/Images/figure3.png?raw=\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; max-width:100%; padding:0px\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Figure 3. Composite Days Diff output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool. Areas with the value = -1 came from the raster with the date closest to the user specified date. All other values were progressively filled in by the tool using the raster with the next closest date. Note the Hudson Bay area is filled with data 31 days prior to the user specified date.</p>\\n\\n<p>The tool then uses the Composite Raster to create a Composite Divergence raster layer. This layer shows how values diverge from the user specified Divergence Value. In this example we are focusing on water temperatures = 4 degrees Celsius. The title of Composite Divergence layer identifies the Divergence Value, the minimum absolute difference in days from the input rasters dates and the name of the input raster dataset that most closely matches the user specified date.</p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\"Composite Divergence output\" src=\"https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/repos/foxcompositerasteranddivergencetool/browse/Images/figure4.png?raw=\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; max-width:100%; padding:0px\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Figure 4. Composite Divergence output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool. The user specified divergence value was 4 degrees Celsius, this output shows how the composite raster diverges from that value. Note that many of the areas that are at or near the target value of 4 degrees Celsius are from No Data areas that the tool filled in with raster input data.<br>\\nExample: where Composite Raster = False When the Composite Raster checkbox is not checked, the tool will identify the raster dataset with the date closest to the user specified input date, add it to the ArcMap project and label it Single Value. The tool will also create a raster divergence output and label it Single Raster Divergence.</p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\"Single Raster output\" src=\"https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/repos/foxcompositerasteranddivergencetool/browse/Images/figure5.png?raw=\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; max-width:100%; padding:0px\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Figure 5. Single Raster output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool, where the Composite Raster option is set to false. Note the areas of No Data when compared to the Composite Raster of Figure 2, shown earlier in this document.</p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\"Single Raster Divergence output\" src=\"https://my.usgs.gov/bitbucket/projects/UMESC/repos/foxcompositerasteranddivergencetool/browse/Images/figure6.png?raw=\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; max-width:100%; padding:0px\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Figure 6. Single Raster Divergence output created by the Composite Raster and Divergence Tool. The user specified divergence value was 4 degrees Celsius, this output shows how the raster diverges from that value. Once again, note the areas of No Data when compared to the Composite Raster Divergence in Figure 4.</p>\\n',\n",

       "     'text': 'title subtitle description\\nD-Claw\\nsoftware for granular-fluid flows\\nD-Claw is numerical software package for simulating granular-fluid flows, such as landslides, debris flows, and lahars. D-Claw is an extension of the Clawpack codes (www.clawpack.org)\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nD-Claw is numerical software for modeling granular-fluid flows. It is built on top of Clawpack (clawpack.org), and is an extension and generalization of the shallow-water code GeoClaw (geoclaw.org), which includes algorithms for general shallow earth-surface flows. D-Claw solves a more general two-phase (granular-fluid mixture) model for landslides, debris flows, and lahars. D-Claw can also be used for simulating hybrid problems that involve the interaction of granular-fluid flows with bodies of water (eg., landslide-generated tsunamis, dam-breach floods, fluid or solid entrainment by inundating flows, such as debris-laden run-off or debris-entraining tsunamis). In the limit of vanishing solid concentrations, D-Claw results theoretically reduce to Geoclaw results (though details of the numerical implementation may differ).\\n\\nThe documentation available with Clawpack (v5) and GeoClaw provide a general overview, however, in addition to unique features, D-Claw is built on top of older versions of Clawpack and GeoClaw (v4.x). (The older v4.x version of Clawpack is available at github.com/clawpack/clawpack-4.x. See clawpack.org for more information.)\\n\\nRunning D-Claw requires additional set-up parameters beyond those of Geoclaw. Documentation for D-Claw is currently unsatisfactory, but in progress. The basics of running it are below. See also the geoclaw/dclaw-apps on github for examples.\\n\\nUse\\n\\nTo use D-Claw as is, it is assumed that you have a unix terminal of some kind (eg., linux or Mac OS...for MS Windows you are on your own, but options exist for terminal emulators).\\n\\nSource code\\n\\nThe source code and latest git repository for D-Claw are available on github:\\n\\ngithub.com/geoflows/D-Claw.\\n\\nA repository for applications (in progress) is also available:\\n\\ngithub.com/geoflows/dclaw-apps.\\n\\nIf you want just the source code without using git, github provides a zipped directory. Otherwise, you can clone either of the repositories with git clone as usual:\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/geoflows/D-Claw.git\\n\\nand\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/geoflows/dclaw-apps.git\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\n\"Installation\" of D-Claw is essentially just setting some environment variables. Compiling and running D-Claw can then be done using make, with a Makefile in an application directory.\\n\\nenvironment variables\\n\\nThe environment variable $CLAW should be set to point to the parent directory of the D-Claw source code. For bash shells:\\n\\nexport CLAW=/path/to/D-Claw\\n\\nTIP: if you are using multiple versions of Clawpack (eg., Clawpack 5.x or GeoClaw and D-Claw), it is advisable to stay mindful of how $CLAW is set, particularly if you are developing/testing code. It is easy to inadvertently compile the wrong code, or fail to incorporate code-changes if $CLAW is set incorrectly. Packages such as the environment modules package, which can dynamically set or change your environment under a given shell to ensure that you have a compatible set of paths/versions of software (eg., $PATH, $CLAW, $PYTHONPATH, $MATLABPATH), are very useful.\\n\\n(Alternatively, one could modify Makefiles if you want to use an environment variable other than $CLAW, such as $DCLAW. However, this can add complications to your path hierarchy for python and matlab when switching between different $CLAWs, as there are modified routines with the same file name...and so it is not recommended without something like environmental modules.)\\n\\npython\\n\\nIn order to use the python set-up scripts that come with D-Claw, you should include $CLAW/python/ in your $PYTHONPATH:\\n\\nexport PYTHONPATH=$CLAW/python:$PYTHONPATH\\n\\nYou can also then import some auxiliary tools from the D-Claw python folder if you find them useful:\\n\\npython> import dclaw python> import dclaw.topotools as dt\\n\\nSee the comments in these modules for more information.\\n\\nNOTE: The current version of D-Claw is compatible with python v2.x. If you prefer python version v3.x, see below about developing and contributing to D-Claw.\\n\\nmatlab\\n\\nIf you are going to use matlab plotting with D-Claw, your $MATLABPATH should include $CLAW/matlabgeo, above but in addition to $CLAW/matlab:\\n\\nexport MATLABPATH=$CLAW/matlabgeo:$CLAW/matlab:$MATLABPATH\\n\\nRunning a D-Claw simulation\\n\\nRunning D-Claw applications is very similar to running applications in Clawpack v5.x. See the documentation at clawpack.org. See also example applications that include necessary files in the application repository, github/geoflows/dlcaw-apps.\\n\\nThe D-Claw executable is made entirely from Fortran source code. However, python is used to set-up and initialize a given D-Claw run, and optionally plot the results. Therefore, ordinary use of D-Claw requires interaction with python scripts and the make program. Modifying Fortran source code is only necessary if you are developing new features or debugging.\\n\\ndirectory and file structure\\n\\nIn summary, a working application directory (it is recommended that this reside away from your D-Claw source code) for a single simulation should contain:\\n\\na Makefile\\npython initialization scripts (setrun.py)\\noptional plotting routines (python or matlab)\\noptional pre-processing routines for topography or other data requirements\\n\\nSetting up a given simulation essentially amounts to modifying the routine setrun.py, to set runtime parameters, initial conditions, and required input data (eg., topography DEMs). Plotting can be done with python or matlab scripts, which are included with D-Claw and application examples (see eg., geoclaw/dclaw-apps on github). See more info on plotting below, or in example applications.\\n\\nmake\\n\\npwd /path/to/myapplication/\\n\\nTo recompile all of the Fortran source code from scratch and create a new executable (\"xgeoclaw\"), issue:\\n\\nmake new\\n\\nThe following make commands will take into account dependency changes to determine the sequence of prerequisite steps that need to be taken. To make or retain an up-to-date executable, issue:\\n\\nmake .exe\\n\\nTo run the executable and produce output (the output files will be placed in a subdirectory indicated in the Makefile), issue:\\n\\nmake .output\\n\\nTo produce plots using python and the setplot.py routine in your application directory, issue:\\n\\nmake .plots\\n\\nNote that each one of the above steps depends on the previous steps if source code or parameters have changed. So, for instance, \"make .plots\" will recompile source code, rerun the executable to produce new output, and finally produce new plots if the source code has changed. If only setrun.py has been modified, it will re-run the existing executable to produce new output. If nothing has changed, make will indicate that nothing needs to be done.\\n\\nWARNING: if the commands make .output or make .plots create a new run, previously made output files in the _output directory will be deleted. If you have changed source code or runtime parameters, but wish to keep your old output for comparison or debugging, take necessary action to save your old files. The Makefile can also be modified to specify your output directory name.\\n\\nTo produce plots with python without checking dependencies, without the risk of deleting wanted output files, you can issue:\\n\\nmake plots\\n\\n(without the \".\").\\n\\nPlotting results\\n\\nmatlab\\n\\nMatlab can be used to plot D-Claw output. From the output directory, use\\n\\nmatlab> plotclaw2\\n\\nthen follow the interactive menu to produce plots for each frame.\\n\\nTIP: For a given application, it is useful to relocate some of the m-files (eg., afterframe.m, setplot2.m, setprob.m, beforeframe.m etc.) included with D-Claw to your local working application directory, where you can modify them to suit you present purposes without modifying your D-Claw source files (note that files in $CLAW/matlabgeo should take precedent over files of the same name in $CLAW/matlab. Unifying these directories is planned in the future, but they currently coexist so that the D-Claw source code can be used to run Geoclaw v4.x applications...more about that in the future).\\n\\nTIP: Note that D-Claw output and these locally modified .m-files (in your application directory) must both be located by matlab, but they are not usually in the same directory. For instance, if the output sub-directory is the current directory where matlab is running, ie.,\\n\\nmatlab> pwd /path/to/myapplication/_output\\n\\nthen you can issue,\\n\\nmatlab> addpath ../\\n\\nto get the local .m-files in the output\\'s parent directory, myapplication/, to the top of your path (ie. Matlab will add the absolute path for ../ to the top of your path for the current session).\\n\\nNOTE: you could alternatively place your local m-files in the output directory...but this is not recommended if you want your local m-files to be part of a repository, as the output directory is best ignored by git, as it is with the applications in the dclaw-apps.\\n\\nMore information on plotting can be found in the dclaw-apps repository.\\n\\npython\\n\\nPython can alternatively be used to produce mapview 2D or 1D cross-sectional plots, as describe above, with:\\n\\nmake .plots\\n\\nor\\n\\nmake plots\\n\\nMake uses setplot.py and matplotlib. Modify the routine setplot.py to your needs.\\n\\nSee clawpack.org, github/clawpack/visclaw and github/geoflows/dclaw-apps for more information.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nIf you would like to make contributions to D-Claw or dclaw-apps, please follow the development workflow used for Clawpack, described at www.clawpack.org/developers. In summary, please fork the repositories to your own github account, and issue pull requests on a feature branch to github/geoflows, eg,:\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/geoflows/D-Claw.git cd D-Claw git remote add username https://github.com/username/D-Claw.git\\n\\nor if you have ssh keys and want to avoid typing your password when you push to github:\\n\\ngit remote add username git@github.com:username/D-Claw.git\\n\\nThese settings can be modified in your local working repository at anytime with git remote set-url.\\n\\nDevelop in a branch other than master:\\n\\ngit checkout -b my_branch\\n\\nAnd then push to your repository on github:\\n\\ngit push username my_branch\\n\\nIssue pull requests from your branch and repository on github.com (username/D-Claw) to contribute features or fixes to the D-Claw master branch at geoflows/D-Claw.\\n\\nUpdate your master branches from geoflows/D-Claw:\\n\\ngit pull origin master\\n\\nand then\\n\\ngit push username master\\n\\nto update your git remote. It is recommended that you do not commit to your own master branches, so that your master branches are easily updated from the geoflows repository.\\n\\nIf you prefer, rename origin to something easy to remember (\"geoflows\" or \"upstream\" or similar):\\n\\ngit remote rename origin geoflows\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nD-Claw inherits the Clawpack licenses and user agreeements.'}},\n",

Two new types of “generalized” boundary conditions facilitate simulation of a wide range of hydrologic processes that interact with the groundwater model, such as rivers, drains, and evapotranspiration. For generalized-flow boundary conditions, gain (inflow) or loss (outflow) of fluid mass varies linearly with pressure, subject to optional upper and lower limits on flow and (or) pressure. For generalized-transport boundary conditions, gain or loss of solute mass or energy varies linearly with concentration or temperature, respectively. Two of the original types of SUTRA boundary conditions—specified-pressure and specified-concentration or temperature—have been modified such that user-specified, conductance-like factors (known as GNUP and GNUU in previous versions of SUTRA) are no longer required. The new lake capability works with all types of SUTRA boundary conditions, including the new generalized boundary conditions, to enable simulation of the interaction of groundwater flow and transport with lake water “ponded” on the surface of a three-dimensional model. SUTRA uses the topography of the top surface of the model, or, optionally, user-specified lake-bottom elevations, to identify potential lakes automatically.

       "     'description': 'The model simulates two-dimensional groundwater flow and base flow in streams in the Great Divide Unit of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest using the analytic element program GFLOW (Haitjema, 1995). Significant streams and lakes in the model domain are represented at varying levels of detail as linesink elements fully connected to the groundwater system. The highest level of detail is given to surface water features within the Forest Unit, while greatly simplified features around the perimeter of the model provide a boundary condition for the groundwater flow system. Groundwater discharge to the linesinks is computed, and routed through the surface water network as base flow. Recharge to the groundwater system was obtained from a separate soil-water-balance (SWB) model, which uses topography, soils, land use, and climatic data to estimate recharge as deep drainage from the soil zone. Estimated average annual recharge rates were supplied to the GFLOW model on a regular 1-km grid covering the model domain, using the Hybrid GFLOW-MODFLOW feature of GFLOW. The model was calibrated to groundwater levels, interpreted lake stages, and estimated annual base flows in streams, with an emphasis on data collected since 1970. Parameters representing hydraulic conductivity, groundwater recharge, and surface water bed-sediment resistance were adjusted using the parameter estimation program PEST, to produce simulated groundwater levels and base flow estimates that agree with field measurements, and input parameter values that are consistent with previous studies and the conceptual understanding of the area. This USGS data release contains all of the input and output for the simulations described in the published report, which can be found in the main directory of this data release.',\n",

    "### A note about formal, standardized metadata\n",
    "I can imagine a question coming up about why we would not pursue tying in formal, structured metadata where it exists into this process, hitting things like FGDC CSDGM records and using the more robust metadata there in this process. It's a valid question and would be worth pursuing. The reasons I did not address that yet in this exploration include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The web links that are often found, provided, and included so far in our exploratory work usually go to some type of information landing page meant for human consumption. It often takes some additional sleuthing or web scraping or other means to discover a link to a formal metadata record. Interpretive conventions could be applied in our case here to make assumptions that a \"catalog.data.gov\" link is going to have a formal metadata record, and with a little rewriting in the URL or further API search, we might find it to exploit. However, I'd argue that the best thing to do is for those catalog systems to put all of that metadata content right into one form or the other of landing page embedded structured metadata that can be read by processes like this as well as by humans.\n",
    "* For right now, we really don't need all that much metadata content to make our model items quite a bit better. Limiting to what we might get through this kind of process keeps things simple and focuses on the highest level metadata elements that we probably care most about at the moment.\n",
    "* The harder issues to work through have to do with the substance of the content and whether or not it adds value in this context. Context in which metadata are produced matters immensely in many cases. Metadata produced in a FGDC CSDGM record for releasing a product is done for one purpose while metadata put into a advertisement page for that product online may be quite different. At this stage, the metadata advertising the product is probably the most useful context for our immediate purposes."
